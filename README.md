# Web Visualization Dashboard

## Background
In an effort to understand the changes in public school enrollment throughout California, we analyzed trends related to unemployment. This project presents our analysis, data, and findings. 

### Tools Used
To build this dashboard, I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap components. 

The analysis was conducted primarily using the Pandas, matplotlib, pyplot, and requests libraries through Python. 

### Data Sources
The data used to complete this analysis came from the California Department of Education and the US Census Bureau's API service.
